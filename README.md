## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- **Database:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for reliable data storage
- **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for consistent development and deployment
- **Real-time Communication:** [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) for live updates


## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm or yarn package manager
- Docker
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Python 3.8+
- Modern web browser

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/a1-remote.git
cd a1-remote/a1
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Database Setup

#### Initialize the Database and Load Data:
In the a1/src/sqldump/A1-Database.sql file, ensure that the path to your employee CSV file is correctly set and accessible by your MySQL instance:
```bash
LOAD DATA INFILE '<path_to_your_employee_data.csv>'
```

Execute the SQL script in `a1/src/sqldump/A1-Database.sql` to set up the required tables. Make sure the database and tables are created successfully.

#### Start All Services
Use Docker Compose to start the necessary services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

View logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 4. Initialize Mock Data
To populate your database with mock data for demo purposes, run the mock data scripts locally. Before doing so, temporarily modify the `.env` file in the `microservices` directory to connect to your local database instead of the deployed one. Use the reference `.env` file setup detailed below for guidance.

```bash
# Navigate to the microservices directory
cd microservices

# Populate user data
python user_populate.py

# Generate additional mock data
python generate_mock.py
```

### 5. Start the Development Server
Launch the development server locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## üèóÔ∏è Build for Production
To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## üß™ Testing
Run tests to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
python pytest
```

## üîë Environment Variables

### Frontend `.env` in `/a1`
Create a `.env` file in the `a1` directory with the following variables:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost
VITE_USER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001
VITE_EMPLOYEE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5002
VITE_WORK_REQUEST_URL=http://localhost:5003
VITE_SCHEDULE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5004
VITE_SCHEDULER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5005
VITE_NOTIFICATION_URL=http://localhost:5008
```

### Microservices `.env` in `/microservices`
Create another `.env` file in `/microservices` with your database configuration:

When using Docker, adjust the `DATABASE_URL` to connect to the database container. Instead of `localhost`, use `host.docker.internal` as the host:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database_name>
```

Replace the placeholders with your database details:
- `<username>`: MySQL username
- `<password>`: MySQL password
- `<host>`: Database host (use `host.docker.internal` if connecting from within Docker)
- `<port>`: Database port (default: 3306)
- `<database_name>`: Name of your database

Example for local setup:
```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://root:password123@localhost:3306/a1_database
```

Example for Docker:
```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql+mysqlconnector://root:password123@host.docker.internal:3306/a1_database
```
